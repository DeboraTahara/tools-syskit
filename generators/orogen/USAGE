Generates a new extension file for an oroGen project. It must be given the name
of the oroGen project as argument. The generated file reopens the classes
defining all the tasks of the project known at the time of generation.

Example: running the following command in a rock_auv app
  roby gen orogen auv_control

  will create a template extension file in models/orogen/auv_control.rb, which
  already contains the definitions of the tasks found in the auv_control oroGen
  project. It also generates an associated test file in
  test/orogen/test_auv_control.rb.
